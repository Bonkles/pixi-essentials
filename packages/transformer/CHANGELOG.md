## 2.2.4

## 2.2.2
Sat, 05 Dec 2020 21:58:39 GMT

### Patches

- Made boxScaling handle higher priority than boxRotation handles. Also, the outer tolerance of boxScaling handles was increased by 50% to account for long arrow cursors. These fix the problem where the object would rotate instead of scale at tiny sizes.
